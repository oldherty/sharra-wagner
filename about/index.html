            <h1>ABOUT SHARRA WAGNER</h1>
            <p>As the second-oldest of eleven children, Sharra had to barter for piano lessons during her childhood. She played clarinet in the school band, saxophone and piano in the jazz band, and learned the trumpet for pep band. She loved to sing in chorus and for solo and ensemble contest, and was the lead in the school musical Leader of the Pack. She was also competitive in cross-country running, basketball, and track and field, earning medals at the state level.</p>
            <p>After high school she was recruited to play basketball at Mesabi Range College, so she put her music studies on hold while she shot three-pointers as an Academic All-Conference point guard. Once at the University of Wisconsin - Superior, she was a double-major in music and English, graduating summa cum laude. While at UWS, Sharra had her first clarinet lesson and fell in love with the study of the instrument. She also continued piano lessons, as well as jazz studies on the baritone saxophone.</p>
            <p>With a Bachelor of Science degree in hand, she continued her studies at the University of Northern Iowa where she was a Teaching Assistant in piano. She taught the group piano classes for music majors, was a pianist for several vocal and instrumental studios, and collaborated with undergraduate and graduate students for their juries, recitals, and auditions. Despite being known on campus as a pianist, her degree was in clarinet performance and she performed in the Wind Symphony and Orchestra. After earning her degree and giving the commencement address, she continued to collaborate on piano and perform with the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Symphony Orchestra on clarinet and bass clarinet.</p>
            <p>Moving further south, Sharra began her doctoral studies at the University of Missouri - Kansas City in the fall of 2009, where she focused solely on the clarinet and earned her Doctor of Musical Arts degree in clarinet performance in May 2013. She was an active member of Musica Nova, the new music ensemble on campus, as well as the UMKC Wind Symphony and Orchestra. She was a performing fellow at The Cortona Sessions for New Music in Cortona, Italy in 2012. Her lecture-recital in 2013 featured seven commissioned works for her clarinet, bassoon, and piano trio, The Filamental Trio, whose CD Illuminations was released in the Summer of 2017.</p>
            <p>Sharra currently teaches at MidAmerica Nazarene University, has an active private studio teaching clarinet, and is the Artistic Director and Vice President for newEar Contemporary Chamber Ensemble. She is also the Sections Manager for the Kansas City Metropolitan Bar Association, a local non-profit supporting the legal profession. In her free time, she loves hiking the mountains in Colorado, running in Gillham Park, cooking satisfying meals with her husband, wandering art museums, listening to podcasts, and catching live jazz and comedy.</p>
