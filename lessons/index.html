            <h1>Lessons</h1>
            <p>Sharra has an active private clarinet studio in her home in midtown Kansas City. Her students have performed in All-State ensembles in Kansas, the Kansas City Youth Symphony, and have made it to the state level of competition in Missouri and Kansas for the Solo and Ensemble contests. She is particularly passionate about teaching students who are motivated and curious.</p>
            <p>Her current studio has students ranging from high school sophomore to retired former Vietnam veteran. Her positive, open, and honest approach allows her to adapt to each student’s learning style. Sharra’s background in piano and theory enhance her lessons, since she can accompany students during lessons in preparation for competitions.</p>
